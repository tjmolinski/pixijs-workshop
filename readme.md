pixi.js Workshop
-------------------
This is a simple implementation of Pong. The user can play by pressing the
up and down arrow keys to move their paddle. Hit the ball with your paddle
to reflect it back to the AI paddle. The AI paddle will follow the ball
and attempt to reflect it back to the user.

Built using webpack, babel, pixi.js and howler.
